#FamousCalendar
> Calendar App UI using Famo.us

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mikefreeman/calendar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mikefreeman/calendar) [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/mikefreeman/calendar.svg)](https://david-dm.org/mikefreeman/calendar) [![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/mikefreeman/calendar/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/mikefreeman/calendar#info=devDependencies)

##Dependencies
It is really quite simple .

First make sure you have node.js installed... without that nothing works!  You can either install it with your favorite package manager or with [the installer](http://nodejs.org/download) found on [nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).

This project relies on grunt-cli, and bower to do all the heavy lifting for you.

```
npm install -g grunt-cli bower
```

##Getting Started

```
npm install && bower install
```

That's it!!!

##Running the Development Server

Simply run ```grunt serve``` and you will start a local development server and open Chrome.  Watch tasks will be running, and your browser will be automatically refreshed whenever a file in the repo changes.

You can run serve with ```--port=9001``` to manually pick the port that the server will run on

*This option is currently borked...*
You can also change the port livereload is running on with the option ```--livereload=8675309```
*... if you think you can fix it check out the [issue on github](https://github.com/Famous/generator-famous/issues/22)*

If you would like to have your server be accessible to other devices on your local machine use the option ```--hostname=0.0.0.0```

##Production

If you would like to compile your project for distribution simply run the command ```grunt``` to build ```dist/``` which will be a deployment ready version of your app.  Preprocessing will be applied to html, all js will be concatenated and minified.  All js / css assets will also have their name prepended with a hash for cache busting.

##Why are styles so strict?

While the default style guidelines are fairly strict, we are doing so with reason.  Famo.us is not only a framework for creating cutting edge web application, but a community project that we are all going to contribute to in the hopes of making the web better.  We truly believe that having consistent style within the community will make it easier for individuals to jump between different Famo.us modules without having to waste valuable time on processing style.

While our Package Manager (which is currently in development) will enforce our style guide if you would like to publish a module, feel free to disable eslint or jscs as you see fit.  If you want to disable linting you will need to comment out lines 18 - 19 in ```grunt/aliases.js```

## Contributing

### Fork the repo
Use github’s interface to make a fork of the repo, then add this repo
as an upstream remote:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/FamousCalendar/FamousCalendar.git
```

### Create your branch based off of the development branch

Your branch should follow this naming convention:
* `feat/thefeature` for feature additions.
* `bug/thebug` for bugfixes.
* `test/thetest` for test files.
* `doc/description` for documentation changes/style fixes.

These commands will help you do this:

``` bash
# Brings you to the development branch
git checkout development

# Creates your branch and brings you there
git checkout -b `your-branch-name`
```

### Make commits to your branch - keep your commits focused!

Make changes and commits on your branch, and make sure that you
only make changes that are relevant to this branch. If you find
yourself making unrelated changes, make a new branch for those
changes.

Your commits should be full sentences and start with a past-tense
verb.

### Rebase upstream changes into your branch

Once you are done making changes, you can begin the process of getting
your code merged into the main repo. Step 1 is to rebase upstream
changes to the development branch into yours by running this command
from your branch:

```
git pull --rebase upstream development
```

This will start the rebase process. You must commit all of your changes
before doing this. If there are no conflicts, this should just roll all
of your changes back on top of the changes from upstream, leading to a
nice, clean, linear commit history.
